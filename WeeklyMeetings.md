#### What did you achieve this week?

* I connected to the server and learned how to copy and edit a file using local computer and server. 
* I was getting dimension error in my code and I solved the problem. I am using ResNet from keras library which is trained using dataset with 1000 classes. However, I was trying to use it for binary classification. I solved the problem using additional top level layer.
* I rewrote the project description.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I lost a lot of time while working on dimension error, however it is solved now.
* I have problem with version of my tensorflow, I am going to ask to Koen.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I am planning to obtain and plot train/validation loss curves. 

#### Where do you need help?

* I donâ€™t have enough information about multitask learning. Maybe to start reading about it it helps me to better understand the problem and is good for the next weeks. Could you suggest me a reading?

#### Any other topics


### Date: [26.06.2018]


#### What did you achieve this week?

* I looked into related articles and used methods to determine the network for classification task. I started to work on ResNet but I did not get any result yet.
* Learned the usage of ROC curve.

#### What did you struggle with?

* While reading paper about crowd disagreement, I have difficulty to understand graphs. I needed to look at the logical background and interpretation of the graphs. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* To work on a classification task. I am planning to train and get result until end of next week.
* If it will finish in next week, I would like to read this paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591569

#### Where do you need help?

* After training the algorithm how can I understand is the algorithm successful or not? Which rate is good?

#### Any other topics
